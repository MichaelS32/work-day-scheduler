# Work Day Scheduler
## Description

This planner allows you to set tasks for general business hours (8am-5pm). By entering text into the input field with a placeholder of "Type your Tasks here" you can then hit the save button for that time frame and your task will get sent to local storage so that your tasks persist even after you refresh the browser. To remove a task simply click on the input field, remove your text and hit save again.

To check color code without time passing go to script.js line 44 and change currentTime to equal any number < = 24 (military time)
